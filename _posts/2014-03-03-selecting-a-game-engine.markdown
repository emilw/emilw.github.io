As a side project i will try to do a game, i have not been doing anything like this since school in the Computer graphics course.

My main aim was to create a 2D sprites game to deploy on different platforms.

I went through the list below with gaming engines.

I looked through, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_game_engines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_game_engines), and [http://www.moddb.com/engines/top](http://www.moddb.com/engines/top), checked:
