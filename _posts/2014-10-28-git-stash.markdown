If you make you want to upgrade your local repository with the latest changes, e.g. merge with non commited local files you can use the command stash.

    //Stash the current work
    git stash

    //Check status, should be empty
    git status

    //Get the list of stashes
    git stash list

    //.....Do operations e.g.
    git pull

    //Apply the stash again
    git stash apply

    //Check status, the stashed files should be marked as before
    git status
