  <h1 class="page-title">Why does this site exists?</h1>
  <p>With my experiences from being a developer, technical deployment consultant, infrastructure solution architect, chief software architect, application consultant, product owner and project manager there is a wast amount of areas that i have worked with over the years. I really like working in different areas and i also like learning new things. What i hate with this is that you get “rusty” with old knowledge quiet fast, and it’s often some pain getting back up to speed with it due to that you almost always need to know the details to make it useful, eg. for coding or configuration. The intention with this site is to help myself in a more efficient way get up to speed again with “old”/forgotten knowledge.</p>

<p>This site is intended to be a collection of quick references for all stuff that i have worked with. The content can be everything from notes to guides and the quality can vary.</p>
